### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am software/web developer with an interest in interactive applications. My work is primarily done with the following languages React, JavaScript, CSS, and html. The projects I have completed here are mainly for learning purposes as I am always seeking to further my knowledge of programing and more.
