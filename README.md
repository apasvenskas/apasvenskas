### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science, with a strong passion for interactive applications and the predictive power of Machine Learning. While I began my journey building projects with React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, my recent focus has shifted toward data-driven solutions. I've been working extensively with Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, and Matplotlib to develop machine learning modelsâ€”primarily using financial data. I thrive on continuous learning and enjoy exploring the intersection of software engineering and intelligent algorithms.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Machine Learning models for finiacial data. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Data Science related project.
